Here you have some questions that you may have about the development of the language.

## How is Ryna being developed?

Ryna is a passion project being developed by only a single programmer. The development cycle is rather
chaotic, adding features as I feel like it and in the order I think is to be expected. Right now, there is no
community around Ryna and I expect it to stay like this for a long time (and maybe this will not ever change), so there is
no need to change my methodology.

In the rare case that this message is no longer applicable, then I guess it would be time to use a more strict
way to program new features and correct bugs. Only time will say.

## Can I help?

Indeed! You can fork the project and try to solve some issues if you feel like it. I'm afraid that the code is not exactly well
documented, but if you still want to ttry the help is greatly appreciated.

## Can I propose something?

Be my guest! Please, create an issue in the repository for any kind of doubt you have about the language and for any new feature you think it would be
nice to have.
